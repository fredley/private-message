Hey!  This is a plain text message, use the following command to encrypt it for a github user:

node encrypt_message.js jlank plain/encrypt_me.txt > secret/secret_for_jlank.out

Make sure to save your plain text messages in the "plain" directory so it
doesn't end up in git's history.

Add a personal note below, I'd love to hear from you!
